       <div className="intro-content"><h1>From the director</h1><p>Many people don’t know about life achievements, they are not aware
of many scopes, and if they know about opportunities so, they face
financial problems that’s why people are lacking to achieve their
goals. In India, many people are unemployed despite they are educated
but don’t have jobs. Because of financial, education, and skill
depletions, people don’t get better jobs some like beggars, tea vendors,
vegetable vendors, etc. People have a degree but don’t have skills, the
main aim is to give ideas through education. So, I want to make
awareness among people and help them to achieve their goals.
Therefore, I intended to have an NGO for the people of India. Our
purpose is to focus on their health too, health is well then everything
works properly, all are relevant to each other: Education-HealthIdeas-social welfare Therefore, to tell about these is a great advantage
for people. </p></div>

       <div className="intro-content"><h1>Our Mission</h1><p>Maanof Federation was founded in Delhi, India 2021, with the
empowering goal of needy people through the quality of education.
Protecting them from Physical and psychological abuse through
education. The mission of the MAANOF FEDERATION is to advance
excellence and equity in education for all underprivileged people. We
want to make people aware because they are not aware of many skills.
People have the opportunity to reach their full potential. To encourage
children to have confidence and motivation and means to make the
world a better place for themselves. We aim to provide education, ideas,
health, and welfare. So people can get a better life for themselves. If
people are getting knowledge so it means they would have to apply this
knowledge in a better place and how they need to know about this,
therefore we are to make them aware of how and where they can get
these opportunities to operate. </p></div>

       <div className="intro-content"><h1>Our Vision</h1><p>where children want to study, parents want to see their children happy, and
they have hope for a future. Every girl/boy needs education- to anyone who
believes, as we do that every child in a diverse democracy deserves access to
permitting knowledge. Every person is loved and respected regardless of
race, religion, caste, or class. They need better cloth, health, food, and a
better environment to live in. How is this possible? Until we are not ready to
raise our hands. So our vision is to make the better life of underprivileged
people. Maanof federation wants to make every children's future bright, if
we don't care from now so their future can be destroyed. Our vision is to
make awareness regarding education, health, ideas, and welfare.
Overall, the vision of an NGO focused on education, skills development,
social welfare, and ideas would be to create a more equitable and inclusive
society, where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and
contribute to the common good. </p></div>
